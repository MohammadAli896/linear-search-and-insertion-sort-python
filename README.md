# linear-search-and-insertion-sort-python
This program will sort a random array of integers using the insertion sort algorithm (similar to sorting a hand of cards) and then will look for a random integer inside the sorted array using the linear search algorithm (checking for a value starting from the beginning to the end of the array).
